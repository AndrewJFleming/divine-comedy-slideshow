            <p>The Divine Comedy Slideshow project is designed to present the whole of Dante's journey, as depicted by Gustave Dore, in a fluid manner. As you study your copy of the Divine Comedy, please reference the illustration to see the artist's impression of that scene. The canto and verse are listed at the base of each card to the left of the illustration's title.</p>
            <p><em>The card illustrations on the homepage are from William Blake's life-long project of illustrating the Divine Comedy.</em></p>
